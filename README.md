PROJECT SCOPE:

FIRST STEP: 
First you need to register an account. After clicking the register button you will see in MongoDB, after it is refreshed, 
the new user that has been added. Then sign in with the credentials that you originally registered with and click the "Login" button 
that will now take you to the home screen. 

SECOND STEP:
On the home screen you can click the dropdown menu option with the different items that are being called from an external API and 
rendered in the UI. Once category is selected you can see items displayed in the UI. Now click on any of the items you would like to
add to the cart. After clicking "Add to Cart" button you will see an alert display in the UI that the item has been added. Once all the items 
are added to the cart that you have chosen you can go into MongoDB and first refresh to see all of the items' "id" in the cart array.

THIRD STEP:
Click on any of the items under the "Top Deal's" tab. It will render a new screen with all of the product data and images that is being called
and set from the external API. To go back to the home screen you can simply click the refresh button in the browser.
